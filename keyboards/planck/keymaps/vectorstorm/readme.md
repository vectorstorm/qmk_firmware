This is just a quick modification of the default configuration for
the Planck EZ.

I'm finding that I have some bad behaviour in the sound handling, and so am
going to play with that in future.

Also, I've set up the default 'esc' to act as lctrl when held, and enter to act
as rshift when held.

Finally, I've hooked up QWERTY and Colemak layouts;  top left and top right keys
respectively, on the Adjust layer.

This is still very much a work in progress!
